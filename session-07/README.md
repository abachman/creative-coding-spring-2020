## Questions for your check-in

Here's a rough outline of the questions I'm interested in asking when we meet to talk about your project. 

It's okay for your answers to be guesses! I just want to make sure that 1) you have everything you need to help you succeed on your project and 2) I know some of what I can expect when I check in with you next. 

- What work have you selected for your project?
- What is interesting to you about this work? 
  - What do you want to capture?
- What direction would you like to take?
  - Is there an existing sketch you want to start from or imitate? (share links!)
  - Is there a particular style or technique you are interested in?
- What effect will interaction (reaction to input) have on your piece?
- How will I know this is your voice? What's your signature?

# Communicating With Code

### Background

Now that our sketches are on the web, we can make them talk to each other!

We can use the p5.websocket library and the p5.js drawing and interaction commands we're already familiar with to make ideas that are bigger than one sketch all by itself.

## Examples

All example sketches require an internet connection. Each uses the p5.websocket library for communication with other sketches through the websocket server at wss://chat.reasonable.systems.

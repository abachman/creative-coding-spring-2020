# 2020-02-10 Shapes, variables, conditions

Two complex drawing commands and some exercises to continue working on our use of variables.

## Demonstrations

- Variables!
- Logic!
- `beginShape` and `vertex`
- `rotate` and `translate` with special guests `pushMatrix` and `popMatrix`

## Exercises

Pick a rule set and design a sketch around it.

We'll start with an example...

#### Example

```
Horizontal lines.
Not parallel to the ground.
Shorter than the canvas.
```

### Option 1

```
Place a circle.
Move it when someone clicks on it.
```

### Option 2

```
Create a typewriter that puts letters anywhere.
Letters are often tilted.
```

### Option 3

```
Draw shapes that are only sometimes visible.
Shapes are sometimes:
- The Sun
- The Moon
- The Snake
- The Ground
```

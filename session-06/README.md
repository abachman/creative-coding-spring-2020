# Video and Sound

The real world is intruding on our beautiful pure computer reality!

Today we're looking at two **libraries** today, provided by The Processing Foundation. One for working with video and the camera that is (probably) attached to your computer, and one for working with sound and the microphone that is (probably) attached to your computer. 

Both libraries can also work with pre-reocorded media and we will see how both things--live captured video or audio and pre-recorded video or audio--kind of look like the same thing to a Processing sketch.
